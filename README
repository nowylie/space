Space Window Manager

This is a project for the development of a Window Manager, currently
going by the name of "space" because I couldn't think of anything better.

HOW TO RUN:

1. Compilation should be pretty straight forward.
2. Each of the components is in a different subdirectory under SRC
3. 'cd' to the directories and run 'make'
4. The best way to test the code is by running it under Xephyr
5. Most linux distributions will have a package for it in their repositories
6. First run Xephyr: "Xephyr -ac -br -noreset -screen 1024x600 :1&"
7. Next, set your DISPLAY variable: "DISPLAY=:1.0"
8. Next, run the components, currently space-wm and space-int are working together:
      "cd src/man/ && make && ./space-man"
      "cd src/int/ && make && ./space-int"
9. space-comp sort of works but it is very unstable:
      "cd src/comp/ && make && ./space-comp"
